# Raspberry Pi Pico Decoder and Hovercraft

## Overview

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Pico Funke Decoder and Hovercraft project! In this exciting endeavor, we aim to create a simple decoder using Python on a Raspberry Pi Pico to interpret signals from a standard radio controller. The ultimate objective is to harness the power of the decoded signals to control a hovercraft, resulting in a fun and innovative project.

## Requirements

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following components:

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico:** The heart of our project, responsible for decoding signals and controlling the hovercraft.

2. **Remote Control (Funke):** A standard radio controller to send signals to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

3. **Receiver:** The counterpart to the radio controller, receiving signals from it and transmitting them to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

4. **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC):** A crucial component for controlling the speed of the brushless motors.

5. **Brushless Motors and Propellers:** Two brushless motors along with their respective propellers to provide the necessary thrust for the hovercraft.

6. **Servo:** A servo motor for controlling the direction of the hovercraft.

7. **Plastic Bag:** A plastic bag to create a skirt around the hovercraft, enhancing its ability to glide on surfaces.

8. **3D-Printed Hovercraft Model:** A 3D-printed model of a hovercraft, serving as the physical structure for the project.

## Assembly Instructions

Follow these steps to assemble the Raspberry Pi Pico Funke Decoder and Hovercraft:

1. **Connect the Radio Controller to the Receiver:** Ensure a stable connection between the radio controller and the receiver.

2. **Connect the Receiver to the Raspberry Pi Pico:** Use appropriate wiring to establish a connection between the receiver and the Raspberry Pi Pico.

3. **Connect ESC to Raspberry Pi Pico:** Wire the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) to the Raspberry Pi Pico to control the speed of the brushless motors.

4. **Connect Brushless Motors and Propellers:** Attach the brushless motors and propellers to the hovercraft model, ensuring proper alignment.

5. **Connect Servo Motor:** Connect the servo motor to control the direction of the hovercraft.

6. **Attach Plastic Bag Skirt:** Affix the plastic bag around the hovercraft model to create a skirt, enhancing its stability and maneuverability.

7. **Upload Python Code to Raspberry Pi Pico:** Write and upload Python code to the Raspberry Pi Pico to decode signals from the radio controller and control the motors and servo accordingly.

8. **Test and Calibrate:** Test the hovercraft in a controlled environment, calibrating the controls as needed for optimal performance.
