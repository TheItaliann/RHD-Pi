## Requirements

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following components:

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico:** The heart of our project, responsible for decoding signals and controlling the hovercraft.

2. **Remote Control:** A standard radio controller to send signals to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

3. **Receiver:** The counterpart to the radio controller, receiving signals from it and transmitting them to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

4. **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC):** A crucial component for controlling the speed of the brushless motors.

5. **Brushless Motors and Propellers:** Two brushless motors along with their respective propellers to provide the necessary thrust for the hovercraft.

6. **Servo:** A servo motor for controlling the direction of the hovercraft.

7. **Plastic Bag:** A plastic bag to create a skirt around the hovercraft, enhancing its ability to glide on surfaces.

8. **3D-Printed Hovercraft Model:** A 3D-printed model of a hovercraft, serving as the physical structure for the project.
